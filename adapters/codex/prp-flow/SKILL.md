# Conversation Flow Design

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Your Mission

Design clear, efficient conversation flows that guide users to their goals while handling edge cases gracefully.

**Golden Rule**: Every conversation should feel natural, reach resolution quickly, and know when to involve a human.

---

## Phase 1: PARSE INPUT

### Input Options

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `--design "flow-name"` | Design new conversation flow |
| `--analyze` | Analyze existing flow for issues |
| `--visualize` | Generate flow diagram |
| `--optimize` | Find bottlenecks and drop-offs |
| `--handoff` | Design human handoff flow |
| No flags | Interactive flow design session |

---

## Phase 2: FLOW DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS

### 2.1 Conversation Flow Components

```markdown
## Flow Building Blocks

### Entry Points
- User initiates (greeting, direct question)
- Proactive trigger (time-based, event-based)
- Handoff from another system

### Dialog Turns
- Bot asks question
- User responds
- Bot processes & responds

### Decision Points
- Intent classification
- Entity validation
- Condition checks

### Actions
- API calls
- Database lookups
- External system updates

### Exits
- Successful resolution
- Human handoff
- User abandonment
- Error/fallback
```

### 2.2 Flow Types

```markdown
## Common Flow Types

### Linear Flow
Simple, step-by-step process
```
Start -> Step 1 -> Step 2 -> Step 3 -> End
```
Use for: Onboarding, simple inquiries

### Branching Flow
Multiple paths based on user input
```
Start -> Question -> [Option A] -> Path A
                  -> [Option B] -> Path B
                  -> [Option C] -> Path C
```
Use for: Product selection, troubleshooting

### Looping Flow
Repeat until condition met
```
Start -> Collect Info -> Validate -> [Invalid] -> Ask Again (loop)
                                  -> [Valid] -> Continue
```
Use for: Data collection, authentication

### Contextual Flow
Different paths based on context
```
[New User] -> Onboarding Flow
[Returning] -> Quick Service Flow
[VIP] -> Priority Flow
```
Use for: Personalized experiences
```

## Phase 3: FLOW DESIGN TEMPLATES

### 3.1 Order Status Flow

```markdown
## Flow: Order Status Check

### Overview
- **Goal**: Help user check order status
- **Avg Turns**: 3-5
- **Success Rate Target**: 95%

### Flow Diagram

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                     ORDER STATUS FLOW                        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

[User]: "Where's my order?"
         |
         v
+---------------------+
| Has Order ID?       |
+---------------------+
    |           |
   Yes          No

    |     +-------------+         |
    |           |                 v
    v           v           +---------+
+---------------------------| Retry   |
| "Anything else I can help?"| (max 2) |
+---------------------------+---------+
    |                              |
    v                              v
[New Intent] or [End]        [Handoff to Human]
```

### Turn-by-Turn Script

**Turn 1 - User Entry**
User: "Where's my order?" / "Track my package" / "Order status"
Intent: `order.status`

**Turn 2 - Collect Order ID (if missing)**
Bot: "I'd be happy to help track your order! Could you share your order number? It starts with ORD- or you can find it in your confirmation email."

User: "ORD-12345" / "It's 12345" / "I don't have it"

**Turn 3a - Order ID Provided**
[API Call: getOrderStatus(order_id)]

If found:
Bot: "Great news! Order ORD-12345 is currently [status].
- Shipped on: [date]
- Expected delivery: [date]
- Tracking: [link]

Is there anything else I can help with?"

If not found:
Bot: "I couldn't find an order with that number. Could you double-check? Or I can look it up with your email address."

**Turn 3b - No Order ID**
Bot: "No problem! I can look it up with your email address. What email did you use for the order?"

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Multiple orders | "I found [N] orders. Which one: [list]" |
| Order not shipped | "Order placed on [date]. Preparing..." |
| Order delivered | "Marked as delivered on [date]. Issues?" |
| Very old order | "That order is from [date]. Need help?" |

### Success Metrics
- Resolution rate: 95%
- Avg turns to resolution: 3
- Handoff rate: <5%
- CSAT: 4.5+
```

### 3.2 Return/Refund Flow

```markdown

## Phase 4: HANDOFF DESIGN

### 4.1 Handoff Triggers

```markdown
## When to Handoff to Human

### Automatic Triggers
| Trigger | Priority | Reason |
|---------|----------|--------|
| User requests human | High | Explicit request |
| 3+ failed attempts | High | AI can't resolve |
| Sentiment negative | Medium | Angry customer |
| High-value customer | Medium | VIP treatment |
| Complex issue detected | Medium | Beyond AI capability |
| Legal/compliance topic | High | Risk mitigation |

### Sentiment Indicators
- Explicit: "agent", "human", "real person", "supervisor"
- Frustration: "this is useless", "doesn't work", "already tried"
- Anger: profanity, caps, "!!!", threats

### Complexity Indicators
- Multiple issues in one request
- Conflicting information
- Requires judgment/exception
- System limitations
```

### 4.2 Handoff Flow

```markdown
## Handoff Flow

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    HANDOFF FLOW                              |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

[Trigger Detected]
         |
         v
+---------------------+
| "I'll connect you   |
|  with a specialist" |
+---------------------+
         |
         v
+---------------------+
| Check Agent         |
| Availability        |
+---------------------+
    |           |
 Available   Unavailable
    |           |
    v           v
+---------+  +-----------------+
|Transfer |  | Collect Contact |
|Now      |  | + Callback      |
+---------+  +-----------------+
    |               |
    v               v
+---------------------------------+
| Pass Context to Agent:          |
| - Customer info                 |
| - Conversation history          |
| - Issue summary                 |
| - Attempted solutions           |
| - Sentiment score               |
+---------------------------------+
```

### Handoff Message Templates

**Warm Transfer (Agent Available)**:
"I'm connecting you with [Agent Name] who can better assist with this. They'll have our full conversation history. One moment please..."

**Queue (Wait Time)**:
"I'm connecting you with a specialist. Current wait time is approximately [X] minutes. While you wait, is there anything else I can help with?"

**Callback (Unavailable)**:
"Our specialists are currently helping other customers. Would you like us to call you back? We can reach out within [timeframe]."

**After Hours**:
"Our support team is available [hours]. Would you like to:
1. Leave a message for callback tomorrow
2. Schedule a callback at a specific time
3. Continue with me for other questions"
```

## Phase 5: FLOW OPTIMIZATION

### 5.1 Metrics to Track

```markdown
## Flow Performance Metrics

### Efficiency
| Metric | Target | Calculate |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Avg turns to resolution | <5 | Total turns / conversations |
| Time to resolution | <3 min | End time - start time |
| Straight-through rate | >70% | No loops / total |

### Effectiveness
| Metric | Target | Calculate |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Resolution rate | >85% | Resolved / total |
| Handoff rate | <15% | Handoffs / total |
| Repeat contact rate | <10% | Same user in 24h |

### Experience
| Metric | Target | Calculate |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| CSAT score | >4.5 | Survey average |
| Drop-off rate | <20% | Abandoned / started |
| NPS | >50 | Promoters - Detractors |
```

### 5.2 Optimization Opportunities

```markdown
## Common Flow Issues

### Too Many Steps
**Symptom**: High drop-off, long resolution time
**Fix**: Combine steps, reduce questions, use defaults

### Unclear Options
**Symptom**: Wrong path selection, confusion
**Fix**: Clearer wording, fewer options, examples

### Dead Ends
**Symptom**: No path forward, frustrated users
**Fix**: Always provide next step or escalation

### Missing Context
**Symptom**: User repeats information
**Fix**: Pass context between turns and handoffs

### Premature Handoff
**Symptom**: High handoff rate, low AI resolution
**Fix**: More training, better fallbacks, more paths
```
