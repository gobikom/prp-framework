description: Orchestrate complete PRP workflow - plan, implement, commit, PR, and review in sequence with context passing
argument-hint: "<feature-description>" or --prp-path <path/to/plan.md> [--skip-review] [--no-pr]
---

# PRP Full Workflow Runner

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Your Mission

Execute the complete PRP workflow end-to-end autonomously. Each step delegates to an existing command — do NOT duplicate their logic.

**Core Principle**: Each step passes context forward to the next. Never re-gather information that a previous step already produced.

**Golden Rule**: Stop immediately on failure. Do NOT continue with broken state.

---

## Step 0: PARSE INPUT

**Determine what was provided:**

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Feature description (text) | Start from Step 1 (create plan) |
| `--prp-path <path>` | Skip to Step 2 (plan already exists) |
| `--skip-review` | Skip Step 6 (review) |
| `--no-pr` | Skip Steps 5 and 6 (PR and review) |

**Set workflow variables:**
```
FEATURE = "{feature description or plan title}"
PLAN_PATH = "{path to plan, or TBD}"
BRANCH = "{TBD — set in Step 1}"
PR_NUMBER = "{TBD — set in Step 5}"
```

---

## Step 1: CREATE BRANCH

**Skip if**: already on a feature branch (not main/master)

```bash
# Check current branch
CURRENT=$(git branch --show-current)

# If on main, create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/{slug-from-feature-description}
```

**Variable update**: `BRANCH = feature/{slug}`

**Failure**: If working directory is dirty on main → STOP, ask user to stash or commit.

---

## Step 2: CREATE PLAN (skip if --prp-path provided)

**⚠️ MUST use Skill tool**: `/prp-plan "{FEATURE}"`

```
Use Skill tool with:
  skill: "prp-core:prp-plan"
  args: "{FEATURE}"
```

This command will:
- Analyze the codebase
- Generate a comprehensive plan
- Save to `.claude/PRPs/plans/`

**Variable update**: `PLAN_PATH = {generated plan path}`

**Failure**: If plan generation fails → STOP, report error.

**❌ DO NOT**:
- Read `prp-plan.md` and execute its logic yourself
- Analyze the codebase and create a plan directly
- Skip the Skill tool because you "know what it does"

**✅ CHECKPOINT**: Did you call the Skill tool with `skill: "prp-core:prp-plan"`?
If NOT → STOP → Go back and call it now.

---

## Step 3: IMPLEMENT

**⚠️ MUST use Skill tool**: `/prp-implement {PLAN_PATH}`

```
Use Skill tool with:
  skill: "prp-core:prp-implement"
  args: "{PLAN_PATH}"
```

This command will:
- Read and execute the plan
- Run validation loops (typecheck, lint, test, build)
- Auto-fix failures
- Write implementation report
- **Generate review context file** (`pr-context-{branch}.md`) ← Token optimization
- Archive the plan

**Wait for completion.** This is the longest step.

**Failure**: If implementation fails after retries → STOP, report which task failed and why.

**❌ DO NOT**:
- Read `prp-implement.md` and execute its logic yourself
- Write implementation code directly without calling the Skill
- Add extra validation steps — `/prp-implement` already has rigorous validation loops
- Skip the Skill tool because you "know what it does"

**✅ CHECKPOINT**: Did you call the Skill tool with `skill: "prp-core:prp-implement"`?
If NOT → STOP → Go back and call it now.

### 3.1 VERIFY Artifacts Created

**After `/prp-implement` completes, verify these files exist:**

```bash
# Get branch name
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Check for report (find the most recent one)
ls -la .claude/PRPs/reports/*-report.md 2>/dev/null

# Check for review context
ls -la .claude/PRPs/reviews/pr-context-*.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Set variables from verification:**
```
REPORT_PATH = {path to report file}
CONTEXT_PATH = {path to pr-context file}
```

### 3.2 FALLBACK: Create Missing Artifacts

**If report is missing**, create a minimal report:

```markdown
# Implementation Report (Fallback)

**Plan**: `{PLAN_PATH}`
**Branch**: `{BRANCH}`
**Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status**: COMPLETE (via run-all)

---

## Summary

Implementation completed via `/prp-core-run-all` workflow.
Detailed report was not generated by `/prp-implement`.

---

## Files Changed

{Run: git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD}

---

## Validation

Run validation commands to verify:
- `{runner} run type-check`
- `{runner} run lint`
- `{runner} run test`
- `{runner} run build`
```

Save to: `.claude/PRPs/reports/{plan-slug}-report.md`

**If pr-context is missing**, create a minimal context:

```markdown
# PR Review Context (Fallback)

**Branch**: `{BRANCH}`
**Generated**: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}

---

## Files Changed

{Run: git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD}

---

## Review Notes

Context was not pre-generated. Review agents will need to analyze files directly.
```

Save to: `.claude/PRPs/reviews/pr-context-{BRANCH}.md`

**Context passed forward**:
- Implementation report at `.claude/PRPs/reports/`
- Review context file at `.claude/PRPs/reviews/pr-context-{BRANCH}.md`
- Validated code on feature branch

---

## Step 4: COMMIT

**⚠️ MUST use Skill tool**: `/prp-commit`

```
Use Skill tool with:
  skill: "prp-core:prp-commit"
  args: "" (no args needed)
```

This command will:
- Stage relevant files
- Generate meaningful commit message
- Commit with Co-Authored-By

**Failure**: If commit fails (pre-commit hooks) → fix and retry (the command handles this).

**❌ DO NOT**:
- Run `git add` and `git commit` directly
- Manually stage files or write commit messages
- Skip the Skill tool because committing "seems simple"

**✅ CHECKPOINT**: Did you call the Skill tool with `skill: "prp-core:prp-commit"`?
If NOT → STOP → Go back and call it now.

---

## Step 5: CREATE PR (skip if --no-pr)

**⚠️ MUST use Skill tool**: `/prp-pr`

```
Use Skill tool with:
  skill: "prp-core:prp-pr"
  args: "" (no args needed)
```

This command will:
- Push branch to remote
- Create PR with summary, test plan, and description
- Return PR URL

**Variable update**: `PR_NUMBER = {created PR number}`

**Failure**: If PR creation fails → STOP, report error (usually auth or branch issue).

**❌ DO NOT**:
- Run `gh pr create` directly
- Manually craft PR title or body
- Skip the Skill tool because PR creation "seems simple"

**✅ CHECKPOINT**: Did you call the Skill tool with `skill: "prp-core:prp-pr"`?
If NOT → STOP → Go back and call it now.

---

## Step 6: REVIEW (skip if --skip-review or --no-pr)

**⚠️ MUST use Skill tool**: `/prp-review-agents {PR_NUMBER}`

```
Use Skill tool with:
  skill: "prp-core:prp-review-agents"
  args: "{PR_NUMBER}"
```

This command will:
- **Detect pre-generated context file** from Step 3 → skip expensive context extraction
- Run applicable specialist agents (code, docs, tests, errors, types)
- Post review summary to PR

**Token optimization**: Because `/prp-implement` already generated `pr-context-{BRANCH}.md`, the review agents will:
- NOT re-fetch PR diff
- NOT re-run validation
- NOT re-read CLAUDE.md
- Only read targeted files per agent domain

**❌ DO NOT**:
- Read code files and review them yourself
- Run review agents logic directly
- Skip the Skill tool because you "can review code"

**✅ CHECKPOINT**: Did you call the Skill tool with `skill: "prp-core:prp-review-agents"`?
If NOT → STOP → Go back and call it now.

**If critical issues found**:
1. Fix each critical issue
2. Run validation: `{runner} run type-check && {runner} run lint && {runner} run test`
3. Commit fixes via Skill tool: `skill: "prp-core:prp-commit"`
4. Push: `git push`
5. Re-run review via Skill tool: `skill: "prp-core:prp-review-agents"` (max 2 cycles)

**If no critical issues**: Proceed to summary.

---

## Step 7: SUMMARY REPORT

Generate final report:

```markdown
## PRP Workflow Complete

**Feature**: {FEATURE}
**Branch**: {BRANCH}
**Status**: Complete

### Steps Executed

| Step | Command | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| Plan | /prp-plan | {path or "skipped"} |
| Implement | /prp-implement | {tasks completed} |
| Commit | /prp-commit | {commit hash} |
| PR | /prp-pr | {PR URL or "skipped"} |
| Review | /prp-review-agents | {verdict or "skipped"} |

### Artifacts

- Plan: `{PLAN_PATH}` (archived)
- Report: `.claude/PRPs/reports/{name}-report.md`
- Review Context: `.claude/PRPs/reviews/pr-context-{BRANCH}.md`
- PR: {URL}

### Review Verdict

{READY TO MERGE / NEEDS FIXES / NOT REVIEWED}

### Next Steps

1. {Based on review verdict}
2. Merge when approved
```

---

## Critical Rules

1. **⚠️ ALWAYS use Skill tool.** You MUST invoke each `/prp-*` command using the Skill tool. Do NOT inline or re-implement their logic. This is the most important rule.

2. **Delegate, don't duplicate.** Each `/prp-*` command is self-contained. Do NOT re-implement their logic in this workflow. Just invoke them via Skill tool in sequence.

3. **Verify artifacts after implement.** After `/prp-implement` completes, always check that report and pr-context files were created. Use fallback creation if missing.

4. **Stop on failure.** If any step fails after its own retry logic, STOP the entire workflow. Do NOT skip to the next step.

5. **Pass context forward.** The review context file from `/prp-implement` is picked up by `/prp-review-agents` automatically. Do NOT re-generate it (unless missing).

6. **No extra validation.** Do NOT add validation steps between commands. Each command validates its own output. Adding more just wastes tokens.

7. **One commit per implementation.** Use `/prp-commit` once after implement. If review fixes are needed, commit those separately.

8. **Max 2 review cycles.** If review still has critical issues after 2 fix-and-review cycles, STOP and report to user.

---

## Token Budget

This workflow is designed for minimal token usage:

| Step | Token Cost | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Plan | Moderate | Codebase analysis needed |
| Implement | High | Code writing + validation |
| Commit | Low | Small command |
| PR | Low | Small command |
| Review | **Low** (with context file) | Pre-generated context skips ~60K tokens |
| **Total** | ~40% less than without optimization | Context file eliminates redundant work |

Without context optimization, review alone would cost ~80-150K tokens.
With context file from implement step, review costs ~15-30K tokens.

---

## Success Criteria

- **SKILL_TOOL_USED**: All `/prp-*` commands invoked via Skill tool (not inlined)
- **PLAN_CREATED**: Plan exists and is valid
- **CODE_IMPLEMENTED**: All tasks complete, validation passing
- **REPORT_EXISTS**: Implementation report exists at `.claude/PRPs/reports/` (created or fallback)
- **CONTEXT_GENERATED**: Review context file exists at `.claude/PRPs/reviews/` (created or fallback)
- **COMMITTED**: Clean commit on feature branch
- **PR_CREATED**: PR exists on GitHub (unless --no-pr)
- **REVIEWED**: Review posted with verdict (unless --skip-review)
- **SUMMARY_REPORTED**: User has clear next steps
