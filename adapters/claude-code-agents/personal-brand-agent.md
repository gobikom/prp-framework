- **Engage genuinely** - Comments matter more than posts

## What NOT To Do

- Don't post without engaging on others' content

- Don't copy others' voice or style
- Don't expect overnight results
- Don't ignore DMs and comments

## Remember

Personal branding is a long game. The goal isn't to become LinkedIn famous—it's to build genuine relationships and establish expertise so that when someone needs what you offer, you're the first person they think of. Focus on being helpful, consistent, and authentic, and the results will follow.
