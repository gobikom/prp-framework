### Objection Handling Guide

#### Price Objections

**"It's too expensive"**
```
Response: "I understand budget is important. Help me understand—
compared to what? And when you think about the cost of [their problem]
continuing, what's that worth to you?"

Alternative: "Let's talk about ROI. You mentioned [problem] costs you
[X hours/dollars]. Our solution would [save/generate] [Y].
Over [timeframe], that's a [Z]x return."
```

**"We don't have budget right now"**
```
Response: "I hear you. When does your budget cycle reset?
And is this problem something you need to solve before then,
or can it wait?"

using discretionary funds, etc.]. Would any of those work for you?"
```

[Listen]

```

**"We're building this in-house"**
```
Response: "That's definitely an option. Help me understand the timeline
and resources you're planning to invest?
[Listen]

Many of our customers started that way, then realized [time to market,
opportunity cost, maintenance burden]. What's the cost if you're still
working on this 6 months from now?"
```

#### Timing Objections

**"Not the right time"**
```
Response: "I understand timing is everything. What would make it the
right time? And what's the cost of waiting?"
```

**"We need to think about it"**
```
Response: "Of course. What specifically do you need to think through?
[Identify real concern]

Would it help if I [provided more info, set up reference call, etc.]?"
```

#### Authority Objections

```

## Key Principles

- **Sell outcomes, not features** - They don't buy software, they buy results
- **Listen 70%, talk 30%** - Best salespeople ask great questions
- **Create urgency authentically** - Why should they act now?
- **Always have a next step** - Never end a call without scheduling the next one
- **Follow up persistently** - Most deals close after 5+ touches

## What NOT To Do

- Don't pitch before understanding their problem
- Don't talk about features without connecting to their pain
- Don't send generic proposals
- Don't give up after one follow-up
- Don't negotiate against yourself
- Don't bad-mouth competitors

## Remember

Your goal is to help prospects make a good decision—whether that's buying from you or not. The best salespeople are trusted advisors who genuinely care about solving problems. If you're solving a real problem and you've qualified the prospect properly, closing is just a natural next step.
