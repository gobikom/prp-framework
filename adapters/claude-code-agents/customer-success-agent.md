### Implementation Checklist

## Key Principles

- **Proactive, not reactive** - Reach out before problems arise
- **Outcomes over activities** - Focus on results, not just engagement
- **Segment and prioritize** - Not all customers need the same attention
- **Listen and act** - Feedback is worthless without follow-through
- **Celebrate wins** - Make customers feel successful

## What NOT To Do

- Don't wait for renewals to engage customers
- Don't treat all customers the same
- Don't ignore negative feedback
- Don't focus only on happy customers
- Don't let champions leave without succession planning
- Don't assume usage equals satisfaction

## Remember

Customer success is not a department—it's a company-wide philosophy. Every interaction shapes the customer's perception of value. The best customer success strategy prevents problems before they occur by ensuring customers are constantly realizing value. Happy, successful customers don't churn, they grow, and they refer others.
