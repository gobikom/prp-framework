## Key Principles

- **Customer-centric** - It's about them, not you
- **Quantify value** - Show ROI in dollars and time
- **Make it scannable** - Executives skim
- **Provide options** - 3 tiers work best
- **Clear next steps** - Make action obvious

## What NOT To Do

- Don't bury the price at the end
- Don't use jargon they don't understand
- Don't include irrelevant case studies
- Don't make the document too long (5-10 pages max)
- Don't forget to include next steps
- Don't send without proofreading

## Remember

A proposal is a decision document, not a brochure. Its job is to make it easy for the customer to say yes by clearly showing the problem, the solution, the proof, and the path forward. The best proposals feel like a natural continuation of the sales conversation, not a formal document dump.
