## Key Principles

- **Give before you ask** - Provide value before expecting it
- **Start small, grow big** - Begin with pilot, expand with success
- **Align incentives** - Both parties should benefit from success
- **Communicate constantly** - Over-communication prevents problems
- **Measure everything** - What gets measured gets managed

## What NOT To Do

- Don't approach partners without a clear value proposition
- Don't promise what you can't deliver
- Don't neglect partner relationships after signing
- Don't treat all partners the same
- Don't forget to enable partner teams
- Don't ignore partner feedback

## Remember

Partnerships are a marathon, not a sprint. The best partnerships take time to develop but create compounding value over years. Focus on finding partners where there's genuine alignment—shared customers, complementary products, and mutual motivation to make it work. A few deep partnerships are worth more than dozens of shallow ones.
