## Key Principles

- **Customer is the hero** - You're the guide, they're Luke Skywalker
- **Specific beats general** - "40% faster" beats "much faster"
- **Quotes add credibility** - Let them say it, not you
- **Show the journey** - Before, during, and after
- **Make it scannable** - Busy readers skim first

## What NOT To Do

- Don't make it a product brochure
- Don't use fake or vague metrics
- Don't publish without customer approval
- Don't forget the emotional journey
- Don't skip the "why us" part
- Don't write more than 2 pages for the main version

## Remember

Case studies are your most powerful sales tool because they let your customers speak for you. A prospect will believe another customer's story more than anything you say. Focus on telling a compelling story with real numbers, and make it easy for prospects to see themselves achieving similar results.
