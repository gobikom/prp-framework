prompt = """# PRP Plan — Create Implementation Plan

Feature: {{args}}

## Mission

Transform the input into a battle-tested implementation plan. PLAN ONLY — no code written. CODEBASE FIRST, RESEARCH SECOND. Read project conventions file.

## Directory Discovery

Run `ls -la` and `ls -la */ 2>/dev/null | head -50`. Do NOT assume `src/` — check: app/, lib/, packages/, cmd/, internal/, pkg/.

## Steps

1. **Detect Input**: PRD file (.prd.md or contains "Implementation Phases") → parse phases, find pending with dependencies complete, note parallelism. Free text → use as feature. Empty → use conversation context.
2. **Parse Feature**: Extract problem, user value, type (NEW_CAPABILITY/ENHANCEMENT/REFACTOR/BUG_FIX), complexity, affected systems. Write user story: `As a <user> I want to <action> So that <benefit>`. **GATE**: If ambiguous → STOP and ask.
3. **Explore Codebase**: Find similar implementations, naming conventions, error/logging/test patterns, integration points, dependencies with versions. Use ACTUAL code snippets with file:line references. Document in table format.
4. **Research**: ONLY AFTER exploration. Official docs (match versions), gotchas, security. Format: URL + KEY_INSIGHT + APPLIES_TO + GOTCHA.
5. **Design UX**: Before/After ASCII diagrams with data flows. Interaction changes table.
6. **Architect**: Analyze architecture fit, execution order, failure modes, performance, security, maintainability. Document approach, rationale, alternatives rejected, scope limits.
7. **Generate Plan**: Save to `.ai-workflows/plans/{feature}.plan.md` with ALL sections: Summary, User Story, Problem/Solution Statements, Metadata, UX Design (before/after + interaction table), Mandatory Reading (P0/P1/P2 files), Patterns to Mirror (ACTUAL snippets), Files to Change (CREATE/UPDATE), NOT Building (scope limits), Step-by-Step Tasks (ACTION/IMPLEMENT/MIRROR/IMPORTS/GOTCHA/VALIDATE), Testing Strategy (tests + edge cases), Validation Commands (6 levels: Static, Unit, Full Suite, Database, Browser, Manual), Acceptance Criteria, Completion Checklist, Risks and Mitigations.

## Output

If from PRD: update status to `in-progress`, link plan file.
Report: file path, summary, complexity, scope, key patterns, research, UX transformation, risks, confidence score (1-10)/10, next step.

**Test**: Could an unfamiliar agent implement using ONLY this plan?
