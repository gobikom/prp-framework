agent: build
---

## Agent Mode Detection

If your input context contains `[WORKSPACE CONTEXT]` (injected by a multi-agents framework),
you are running as a sub-agent. Apply these optimizations:

- **Skip Phase 0** (project environment detection) — if the context includes a `toolchain`
  JSON block with runner/type_check/lint/test/build commands, use those directly.
  If a plan Metadata table is present, plan commands still take precedence.
- **Skip CLAUDE.md reading** in Phase 1 — already loaded by parent session.
- **Phase 1 (Load Plan)**: If no plan file path in `$ARGUMENTS`, check context files for
  plan content — the multi-agents planner may have passed it inline.

All other phases (implementation, validation loops, reporting) run unchanged.

---

# PRP Implement — Execute Implementation Plan

## Input

Path to plan file: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Mission

Execute the plan end-to-end with rigorous self-validation. You are autonomous.

**Core Philosophy**: Validation loops catch mistakes early. Run checks after every change. Fix issues immediately. The goal is a working implementation, not just code that exists.

**Golden Rule**: If a validation fails, fix it before moving on. Never accumulate broken state.

---

## Phase 0: DETECT - Project Environment

### 0.1 Identify Package Manager

Check for these files to determine the project's toolchain:

| File Found | Package Manager | Runner |
|------------|-----------------|--------|
| `bun.lockb` | bun | `bun` / `bun run` |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | pnpm | `pnpm` / `pnpm run` |
| `yarn.lock` | yarn | `yarn` / `yarn run` |
| `package-lock.json` | npm | `npm run` |
| `pyproject.toml` | uv/pip | `uv run` / `python` |
| `Cargo.toml` | cargo | `cargo` |
| `go.mod` | go | `go` |

**Store the detected runner** — use it for all subsequent commands.

> **Plan-provided commands take precedence**: If the plan contains a Metadata table with Runner/Type Check/Lint/Test/Build commands, use those directly instead of auto-detecting. Plan commands were verified during planning and are more reliable.

### 0.2 Identify Validation Scripts

Check `package.json` (or equivalent) for available scripts:
- Type checking: `type-check`, `typecheck`, `tsc`
- Linting: `lint`, `lint:fix`
- Testing: `test`, `test:unit`, `test:integration`
- Building: `build`, `compile`

**Use the plan's "Validation Commands" section** — it should specify exact commands for this project.

---

## Phase 1: LOAD - Read the Plan

### 1.1 Load Plan File

```bash
cat $ARGUMENTS
```

### 1.2 Extract Key Sections

Locate and understand:

- **Plan Metadata** (frontmatter) — Runner, commands, mode, status. **Update status from `pending` to `in-progress`.**
- **Metadata table** — Runner and pre-filled validation commands (Type Check, Lint, Test, Build). **If present, use these instead of auto-detecting in Phase 0.**
- **Summary** — What we're building
- **Patterns to Mirror** — Code to copy from
- **Files to Change** — CREATE/UPDATE list with **Insert At** hints (line numbers are hints — verify before editing)
- **Integration Points** — Where new code hooks into existing code (caller, hook location, wiring details)
- **Step-by-Step Tasks** — Implementation order
- **Validation Commands** — How to verify (USE THESE, not hardcoded commands)
- **Confidence Score** — Plan quality indicator (for reporting)
- **Acceptance Criteria** — Definition of done

### 1.3 Validate Plan Exists

**If plan not found:**

```
Error: Plan not found at $ARGUMENTS

Create a plan first: /prp:plan "feature description"
```

**PHASE_1_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Plan file loaded
- [ ] Key sections identified
- [ ] Tasks list extracted

---

## Phase 2: PREPARE - Git State

### 2.1 Check Current State

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --porcelain
git worktree list
```

### 2.2 Branch Decision

| Current State | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| In worktree | Use it (log: "Using worktree") |
| On main, clean | Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/{plan-slug}` |
| On main, dirty | STOP: "Stash or commit changes first" |
| On feature branch | Use it (log: "Using existing branch") |

### 2.3 Sync with Remote

```bash
git fetch origin
git pull --rebase origin main 2>/dev/null || true
```

**PHASE_2_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] On correct branch (not main with uncommitted work)
- [ ] Working directory ready
- [ ] Up to date with remote

---

## Phase 3: EXECUTE - Implement Tasks (TDD Approach)

**For each task in the plan's Step-by-Step Tasks section:**

### 3.1 Read Context

1. Read the **MIRROR** file reference from the task
2. Understand the pattern to follow
3. Read any **IMPORTS** specified
4. Read the **Testing Strategy** section from the plan for relevant test specs

### 3.2 Write Test First (RED)

> **Test-first applies to tasks that CREATE new functions/modules.**
> For tasks that UPDATE configuration, schema, or wiring — skip to 3.3.

1. Create the test file for this task (or add test cases to existing test file)
2. Write test cases based on the plan's Testing Strategy section:
   - Happy path tests
   - Error/edge case tests from the plan's Edge Cases Checklist
3. Run tests — they SHOULD FAIL (RED) because implementation doesn't exist yet
4. If tests pass without implementation — tests are not testing the right thing, rewrite

### 3.3 Implement (GREEN)

1. Make the change exactly as specified in the task
2. Follow the pattern from MIRROR reference
3. Handle any **GOTCHA** warnings
4. Run tests — they should now PASS (GREEN)

### 3.4 Validate Immediately

**After EVERY file change, run the type-check command from the plan's Validation Commands section.**

Common patterns:
- `{runner} run type-check` (JS/TS projects)
- `mypy .` (Python)
- `cargo check` (Rust)
- `go build ./...` (Go)

**If types fail:**

1. Read the error
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run type-check
4. Only proceed when passing

### 3.5 Track Progress

Log each task as you complete it (include TDD status):

```
Task 1: CREATE src/features/x/models.ts — Test: ✅ (3 cases) — Impl: ✅
Task 2: CREATE src/features/x/service.ts — Test: ✅ (5 cases) — Impl: ✅
Task 3: UPDATE src/routes/index.ts — Impl: ✅ (no test-first for wiring)
```

**Deviation Handling:**
If you must deviate from the plan:

- Note WHAT changed
- Note WHY it changed
- Continue with the deviation documented

**PHASE_3_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] All tasks executed in order
- [ ] Tests written BEFORE implementation for new functions/modules
- [ ] Each task passed type-check
- [ ] Deviations documented

---

## Phase 4: VALIDATE - Full Verification

### 4.1 Static Analysis

**Run the type-check and lint commands from the plan's Validation Commands section.**

Common patterns:
- JS/TS: `{runner} run type-check && {runner} run lint`
- Python: `ruff check . && mypy .`
- Rust: `cargo check && cargo clippy`
- Go: `go vet ./...`

**Must pass with zero errors.**

If lint errors:

1. Run the lint fix command (e.g., `{runner} run lint:fix`, `ruff check --fix .`)
2. Re-check
3. Manual fix remaining issues

### 4.2 Unit Tests

**You MUST write or update tests for new code.** This is not optional.

**Test requirements:**

1. Every new function/feature needs at least one test
2. Edge cases identified in the plan need tests
3. Update existing tests if behavior changed

**Write tests**, then run the test command from the plan.

Common patterns:
- JS/TS: `{runner} test` or `{runner} run test`
- Python: `pytest` or `uv run pytest`
- Rust: `cargo test`
- Go: `go test ./...`

**If tests fail:**

1. Read failure output
2. Determine: bug in implementation or bug in test?
3. Fix the actual issue
4. Re-run tests
5. Repeat until green

### 4.2.1 Coverage Check

**After tests pass, verify coverage on new/changed code.**

1. **Detect coverage tool:**

| Ecosystem | Coverage Command | Report |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| JS/TS (jest) | `{runner} test --coverage` | `--coverageReporters=text` |
| JS/TS (vitest) | `{runner} run test --coverage` | built-in |
| Python | `pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing` | or `coverage run -m pytest && coverage report` |
| Rust | `cargo tarpaulin` | or `cargo llvm-cov` |
| Go | `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./... && go tool cover -func=coverage.out` | built-in |

2. **Focus on new/changed files only:**

```bash
# Get list of changed source files (exclude tests themselves)
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx|py|rs|go)$' | grep -v -E '(test|spec|__test__)' )
```

3. **Evaluate against threshold:**

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Coverage >= 90% on new code | Proceed to Phase 4.3 |
| Coverage 70-89% on new code | Write additional tests for uncovered paths, re-run until >= 90% |
| Coverage < 70% on new code | Major gap — review test strategy, write tests for all critical paths |
| No coverage tool available | Skip with warning: "Coverage tool not detected — relying on review phase" |

**Coverage target: 90% on new/changed code** (not overall project coverage).

**Important**: This is a lightweight metric gate. The deeper behavioral quality analysis happens later during the review phase.

### 4.2.5 Integration Tests (conditional)

> **Run if**: Plan's Testing Strategy includes integration test specifications, OR project has `test:integration` or `test:e2e` script.
> **Skip if**: No integration test specs in plan and no integration test script exists.

1. Check for integration test command in plan or package.json/config
2. Run integration tests:
   ```bash
   {runner} run test:integration  # or equivalent from plan
   ```
3. **If fail**: Read error — fix — re-run — only proceed when passing

### 4.3 Build Check

**Run the build command from the plan's Validation Commands section.**

Common patterns:
- JS/TS: `{runner} run build`
- Python: N/A (interpreted) or `uv build`
- Rust: `cargo build --release`
- Go: `go build ./...`

**Must complete without errors.**

### 4.4 Integration Testing (if applicable)

**If the plan involves API/server changes, use the integration test commands from the plan.**

Example pattern:
```bash
# Start server in background (command varies by project)
{runner} run dev &
SERVER_PID=$!
sleep 3

# Test endpoints (adjust URL/port per project config)
curl -s http://localhost:{port}/health | jq

# Stop server
kill $SERVER_PID
```

### 4.5 Edge Case Testing

Run any edge case tests specified in the plan.

### 4.6 Security Checks (conditional — basic SAST)

> **Run if**: Feature involves user input handling, authentication, or data storage.
> **Skip if**: Internal tooling, tests-only changes, or documentation.

**Check for common security issues in changed files:**

1. **Hardcoded secrets**: Search for API keys, tokens, passwords in source
2. **SQL injection patterns**: Search for string concatenation in queries
3. **Unsafe eval/exec**: Search for `eval()`, `exec()`, `Function()` in changed files

**If issues found**: Fix immediately. If false positive, add inline comment explaining.

### 4.7 Performance Regression (conditional)

> **Run if**: Plan's Testing Strategy includes performance benchmarks AND project has benchmark tooling.
> **Skip if**: No performance benchmarks in plan or no benchmark tool available.

1. Check for benchmark command: `test:bench`, `bench`, or plan-specified command
2. If available, run benchmark and compare against plan's baseline targets
3. Flag any regression > 20% from baseline

### 4.8 API Contract Validation (conditional)

> **Run if**: Project has OpenAPI spec, GraphQL schema, or tRPC router, AND feature modifies API surface.
> **Skip if**: No API schema files, or feature doesn't touch API endpoints.

1. Detect API schema: `openapi.yaml`, `openapi.json`, `schema.graphql`, tRPC routers
2. Validate spec/schema is still valid after changes
3. For tRPC: type-check covers this (already done in 4.1)

**PHASE_4_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Type-check passes (command from plan)
- [ ] Lint passes (0 errors)
- [ ] Tests pass (all green)
- [ ] Coverage >= 90% on new/changed code (or skipped if no coverage tool)
- [ ] Integration tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Security checks pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance regression check (if applicable)
- [ ] API contract validation (if applicable)

## Phase 5: REPORT - Create Implementation Report

### 5.1 Create Report Directory

```bash
mkdir -p .prp-output/reports
```

### 5.2 Generate Report

**Artifact Naming (Timestamp Format)**:

```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
ls .prp-output/reports/{name}-report*.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Path**: `.prp-output/reports/{name}-report-{TIMESTAMP}.md`

> **Note**: Uses timestamp format to prevent overwriting previous reports.

```markdown
# Implementation Report

**Plan**: `$ARGUMENTS`
**Source Issue**: #{number} (if applicable)
**Branch**: `{branch-name}`
**Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status**: {COMPLETE | PARTIAL}

---

## Summary

{Brief description of what was implemented}

---

## Assessment vs Reality

Compare the original plan's assessment with what actually happened:

| Metric | Predicted | Actual | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Complexity | {from plan} | {actual} | {Why it matched or differed} |
| Confidence | {from plan} | {actual} | {e.g., "root cause was correct" or "had to pivot"} |

**If implementation deviated from the plan, explain why:**

- {What changed and why}

---

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | File | Status |

| 1 | {task description} | `src/x.ts` | ✅ |
| 2 | {task description} | `src/y.ts` | ✅ |

---

## Validation Results

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Type check | ✅ | No errors |

{List any issues and how they were resolved, or "None"}

---

## Tests Written

| Test File | Test Cases |

| `src/x.test.ts` | {list of test functions} |

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review implementation
- [ ] Create PR: `gh pr create` (if applicable)
- [ ] Merge when approved
```

### 5.3 Update Source PRD (if applicable)

**Check if plan was generated from a PRD:**
- Look in the plan file for `Source PRD:` reference
- Or check if plan filename matches a phase pattern (e.g., `feature-phase-1.plan.md`)

**If PRD source exists, you MUST update it:**

1. **Read the PRD file** using the path from plan's metadata
2. **Find the Implementation Phases table** in the PRD
3. **Locate the row** matching the phase name from this plan
4. **Update the row** by changing:
   - Status: `in-progress` → `complete`
   - Add completion date if there's a date column
5. **Save the PRD file**

**Example before:**
```markdown
| 1 | User Authentication | in-progress | `plans/auth.plan.md` |
```

**Example after:**
```markdown
| 1 | User Authentication | complete | `plans/auth.plan.md` |
```

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT skip this step. The PRD tracks overall progress and other phases depend on accurate status.

### 5.4 Archive Plan to Completed

**Always archive the plan after successful implementation:**

```bash
# Create completed directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .prp-output/plans/completed

# Move plan to completed folder
mv "$ARGUMENTS" .prp-output/plans/completed/
```

**Verify the move:**
```bash
ls -la .prp-output/plans/completed/
```

**If move fails** (e.g., file already exists), use a timestamped name:
```bash
mv "$ARGUMENTS" ".prp-output/plans/completed/$(basename $ARGUMENTS .md)-$(date +%Y%m%d).md"
```

### 5.5 Generate Review Context File (for run-all workflow)

**Purpose**: Pre-generate context for review to save ~60K tokens when running via run-all workflow.

**CRITICAL**: Generate this file even if implementation fails early. Include note: "Implementation incomplete at task {N}/{total}. Partial context for review." List completed tasks with validation status and remaining tasks. This enables review to provide partial feedback.

**Path**: `.prp-output/reviews/pr-context-{BRANCH}.md`

```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
mkdir -p .prp-output/reviews
```

**Generate the context file:**

```markdown
# PR Review Context

**Branch**: `{BRANCH}`
**Generated**: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}
**Source Plan**: `$ARGUMENTS`

---

## Files Changed

{List from git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD}

| File | Action | Summary |
|------|--------|---------|
| `src/x.ts` | CREATE | {brief description} |
| `src/y.ts` | UPDATE | {brief description} |

---

## Implementation Summary

{Copy from the report's Summary section}

---

## Validation Status

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Type check | ✅ |
| Lint | ✅ |
| Tests | ✅ ({N} passed) |
| Build | ✅ |

---

## Key Changes for Review

### New Files
{List new files with brief purpose}

### Modified Files
{List modified files with what changed}

### Tests Added
{List test files and what they cover}

---

## Review Focus Areas

Based on implementation:
- {Area 1 that reviewers should focus on}
- {Area 2 that might need extra attention}
- {Any gotchas or edge cases}
```

**Save the file** to `.prp-output/reviews/pr-context-{BRANCH}.md`

**PHASE_5_CHECKPOINT:**

- [ ] Report created at `.prp-output/reports/{name}-report-{TIMESTAMP}.md`
- [ ] PRD updated (if applicable) — phase status changed from `in-progress` to `complete`
- [ ] Plan moved to `.prp-output/plans/completed/`
- [ ] Verified plan file no longer exists in original location
- [ ] Review context file created at `.prp-output/reviews/pr-context-{BRANCH}.md`

**GATE**: Do NOT proceed to Phase 6 until plan is archived. This prevents re-running the same plan.

---

## Phase 6: OUTPUT - Report to User

```markdown
## Implementation Complete

**Plan**: `$ARGUMENTS`
**Source Issue**: #{number} (if applicable)
**Branch**: `{branch-name}`
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Validation Summary

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Type check | ✅ |
| Lint | ✅ |
| Tests | ✅ ({N} passed) |
| Build | ✅ |

### Files Changed

- {N} files created
- {M} files updated
- {K} tests written

### Deviations

{If none: "Implementation matched the plan."}
{If any: Brief summary of what changed and why}

### Artifacts

- Report: `.prp-output/reports/{name}-report-{TIMESTAMP}.md`
- Review Context: `.prp-output/reviews/pr-context-{BRANCH}.md`
- Plan archived to: `.prp-output/plans/completed/`

{If from PRD:}
### PRD Progress

**PRD**: `{prd-file-path}`
**Phase Completed**: #{number} - {phase name}

| # | Phase | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
{Updated phases table showing progress}

**Next Phase**: {next pending phase, or "All phases complete!"}
{If next phase can parallel: "Note: Phase {X} can also start now (parallel)"}

To continue: `/prp:plan {prd-path}`

### Next Steps

1. Review the report (especially if deviations noted)
2. Create PR: `gh pr create` or `/prp:pr`
3. Merge when approved
{If more phases: "4. Continue with next phase: `/prp:plan {prd-path}`"}
```

> **Note for orchestrators**: The "Next Steps" above are for standalone usage only. If this command was invoked as part of run-all, the orchestrator should ignore these suggestions and proceed to its next step (Step 3.1: verify artifacts, then Step 4: commit).

---

## Handling Failures

### Type Check Fails

1. Read error message carefully
2. Fix the type issue
3. Re-run the type-check command
4. Don't proceed until passing

### Tests Fail

1. Identify which test failed
2. Determine: implementation bug or test bug?
3. Fix the root cause (usually implementation)
4. Re-run tests
5. Repeat until green

### Lint Fails

1. Run the lint fix command for auto-fixable issues
2. Manually fix remaining issues
3. Re-run lint
4. Proceed when clean

### Build Fails

1. Usually a type or import issue
2. Check the error output
3. Fix and re-run

### Integration Test Fails

1. Check if server started correctly
2. Verify endpoint exists
3. Check request format
4. Fix implementation and retry

### Early Abort (any phase)

**Jump to Phase 5.5 (Generate Review Context) before stopping** — generate partial context with completed/remaining tasks, then Phase 5.2 (Report) if possible. Partial feedback is better than no feedback.

---

## Success Criteria

- TASKS_COMPLETE: All plan tasks executed
- TYPES_PASS: Type-check command exits 0
- LINT_PASS: Lint command exits 0 (warnings OK)
- TESTS_PASS: Test command all green
